# `TextFragment` component
Astronaut:
```javascript
TextFragment() ()
```

HTML:
```html
<span></span>
```

A fragment of text that can contain textual information that is stored in its own element. `TextFragment`s are rendered as inline elements, meaning that they do not break the text flow, but still wrap onto new lines.
