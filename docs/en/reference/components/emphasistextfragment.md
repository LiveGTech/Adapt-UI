# `EmphasisTextFragment` component
Astronaut:
```javascript
EmphasisTextFragment() ()
```

HTML:
```html
<strong></strong>
```

A fragment of text that can contain textual information that is stored in its own element, presented with an italic text style (typically to represent emphasised/italicised text). `EmphasisTextFragment`s are rendered as inline elements, meaning that they do not break the text flow, but still wrap onto new lines.
